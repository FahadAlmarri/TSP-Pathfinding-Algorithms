# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver and Pathfinding Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and find optimal paths between cities. Algorithms implemented include Simulated Annealing, Hill Climbing, BFS (Breadth-First Search), and UCS (Uniform Cost Search).

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique for optimization.
- **Hill Climbing**: A local search algorithm for finding local optima.
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: A graph traversal algorithm for unweighted graphs.
- **UCS (Uniform Cost Search)**: A graph traversal algorithm for finding the cheapest path.

## Usage
- Each algorithm is implemented in Python and can be run individually.
- Provide input data (city coordinates, distances) to test the algorithms.
- Visualize the results to see how each algorithm optimizes the TSP and finds paths between cities.

## Examples
- Include examples of solving the TSP with sample input data.
- Visualize the paths and optimizations achieved by each algorithm.
